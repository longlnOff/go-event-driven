# Further reading on component tests

Testing is a long topic and could be a whole different training.
If you want to learn more, you can read more about testing on [our blog](https://threedots.tech/tags/testing/).

After completing the setup of component tests, it's not a big deal to add more of them.
We won't verify your tests in the following exercises, but we highly encourage you to extend your test suite.
At some point, we will come back to them!

You can experiment with writing tests before the implementation, TDD-style (Test-Driven Development).
It often helps with designing an API and understanding how it should work.
